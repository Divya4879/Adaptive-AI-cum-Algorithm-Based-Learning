# Adaptive AI Tutor - AlgoFest Hackathon

## 🎯 Project Overview
An intelligent tutoring system that adapts to student cognitive load using Bayesian inference and multi-armed bandit algorithms.

## 🧠 Core Algorithms
- **Cognitive Load Detection**: Real-time analysis of response patterns
- **Adaptive Difficulty Engine**: Multi-armed bandit for optimal question selection
- **Bayesian Knowledge Tracing**: Student knowledge state modeling

## 🏗️ Architecture
```
Frontend (React) → API Gateway → Flask Backend → ML Models
                                      ↓
                              PostgreSQL + Redis
```

## 🚀 Tech Stack
- **Backend**: Python, Flask, SQLAlchemy
- **Frontend**: React.js, Chart.js
- **ML/AI**: PyTorch, Scikit-learn, NumPy, Pandas
- **Database**: PostgreSQL, Redis
- **Deployment**: Render (Backend), Vercel (Frontend)
